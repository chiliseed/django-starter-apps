Django Starter Applications
===========================

This repo contains different dockerized django starter projects, with basic use cases.

Locally, you can run the code with django compose or use our helper tool `ddc-shob <https://github.com/chiliseed/django-compose-shob>`_.

Remotely, you can use our `Chiliseed service <https://chiliseed.com>`_ to run it on AWS.

How to use
----------

1. Clone this repo locally
2. Rename upper most folder to something meaningful to you
3. Optionally, recommended, update packages in ``requirements`` folder to latest versions
4. Rename ``container_name`` in ``docker_compose.yml`` to something meaningful to you
5. Rename network in ``docker_compose.yml`` to something meaningful to you
6. ``cp .env.template .env`` and fill in the blanks
7. You might also want to remove the ``LICENSE``, unless your project is also open source and MIT license is good for you
8. ``ddc-shob start`` or (``docker-compose up -d``) and see your project being setup and started
9. You might probably want to remove ``dictionary`` application and re-create the database (``ddc-shob purge-db`` can help you with that)
